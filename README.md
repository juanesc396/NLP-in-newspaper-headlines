# NLP-in-newspaper-headlines
 This project seeks to train an nlp algorithm based on headlines scraped from newspapers.

In recent times, I have been observing how there is a large amount of news with negative content. For this reason I set out to learn Natural Language Processing while finding out what percentage of news was negative. This project seeks to answer that unknown.

The tecnologies i used are:

- Scrapy: Scrape the newspapers
- Spacy: Library that allows me to train a Text Classification model
- Pandas: ETL 
- MongoDB: To store the data from newspapers

The model was tested by F1-Score.
